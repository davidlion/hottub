HotTub
======
HotTub is built on top of OpenJDK 8.
OpenJDK 8 uses Mercurial and the "[trees][1]" extension for version control.
We tried using their setup, but ultimately switched to git as it fit our work-flow better (whether this was the best choice is another discussion). 

Please read our research paper: "[Don't Get Caught In the Cold, Warm-up Your JVM Understand and Eliminate JVM Warm-up Overhead in Data-parallel Systems][2]" for more details of HotTub.

## Building
First configure OpenJDK normally - see `README.openjdk.txt` (renamed from `README`) and `README-builds.html`.
You can see options with `bash ./configure --help`.
Below is a quick overview which should be able to get you started, but you should still read OpenJDK's instructions.

### OpenJDK
Compiling OpenJDK requires a "bootstrap" Java installation.
When you run `bash ./configure`, it chooses a Java installation with the following preference:
	- `--with-boot-jdk=<path/to/java/home>` flag: path to a Java installation, where the `java` executable is `<path/to/java/home>/bin/java`
	- `JAVA_HOME` environment variable: path to a Java installation, as above, e.g. what you use when configuring Hadoop
	- `java` on the path

You can set the debug level with `--with-debug-level=`.
The options are `release` (default), `fastdebug`, and `slowdebug` (no optimizations).

OpenJDK source includes an empty CA certificates file in `./jdk/src/share/lib/security/cacerts`.
From `README-builds.html`: "Failure to provide a populated cacerts file will result in verification errors of a certificate chain during runtime."
You can specify a cacerts file, e.g. from a Java installation from your distro's repo, with `--with-cacerts-file=`.

Example:
```
bash ./configure --with-boot-jdk=/usr/lib/jvm/java-8-oracle \
	--with-debug-level=fastdebug \
	--with-cacerts-file=/usr/lib/jvm/java-8-oracle/jre/lib/security/cacerts
```

#### Additional notes
If you get errors about `freetype` missing, but it is installed in your system, use the `--with-freetype-lib=` and `--with-freetype-include=` flags.
You can use `freetype-config --libs` which should give linker flags - e.g. `-L/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu -lfreetype -lz -lpng12`,
and `freetype-config --cflags` which should give compiler flags - e.g. `-I/usr/include/freetype2`.
With these two paths from the `-L` and `-I` flags, you would configure like `bash ./configure --with-freetype-lib=/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu --with-freetype-include=/usr/include/freetype2`.

### HotTub
To build HotTub, run `./make_hottub.sh <image name> [<jvm build type>]`, where `<jvm build type>` is `release`, `fastdebug`, or `slowdebug`.
See the OpenJDK readmes for more information.

An image `j2sdk-image.java8.<image name>` will be copied to this project's root dir (this file's dir).
This image dir is `JAVA_HOME`, as explained above in the **OpenJDK** section, and you may want to add `$JAVA_HOME/bin` to your `PATH`.
If the shell variable `JVMS_DIR` is set (as an environment variable or by modifying the script),
the script will also copy the image there, and create a symlink `$JVMS_DIR/java_home`.

The script `make_hottub.sh` builds the static analysis files, "client" files, and OpenJDK (the "server" logic is inside OpenJDK code).

## Diffs
Run `git diff vanilla master` to get a patch.
To apply HotTub changes to another OpenJDK project (e.g. updated source), you can run `patch -p1 < hottub.patch` in the root of the other project.

To apply OpenJDK changes to HotTub, clone a new OpenJDK project, and recursively copy the updated OpenJDK source to the `vanilla` branch of HotTub.
Git will see all the changes (you should double check that things look right), and you can commit to the `vanilla` branch.
You can then merge `vanilla` into `master`.

## Flags
* -hottub                    : enable hottub
* -XX:+HotTubReinit          : enable class re-initialization
* -XX:+HotTubLog             : enable logging
* -XX:+HotTubTmp             : enable temporary (debugging) features
* -XX:HotTubReinitSkip       : TODO add me
* -XX:+ProfileIntComp        : enable profiling of interpretered, and compiled (jitted + native) code
* -XX:+ProfileIntCompJitOnly : only profile jitted code; native time included in interpreted time, rather than compiled time
* -DPrintClassLoading=true   : (property) on thread exit output class loading statistics for the thread

## Interpreter, Compiled/Jit, Native code profiling
With the exception of blocking compiled time (e.g. if Java is run with the `-comp` or `-XX:+CompileTheWorld` flag),
you must first enable profiling with the `-XX:+ProfileIntComp` flag, or you will get that the interpreter is executing 100% of the time.
The following instance methods are added to the `java.lang.Thread` class, as the counters are per-thread.

```
/**
 * Reset the counters
 */
void Thread#resetIntCompTimes();
/**
 * Get blocking compile time in nanoseconds
 */
long Thread#getBlockingCompileTime();
/**
 * Get interpreter time in nanoseconds
 */
long Thread#getIntTime();
/**
 * Get compiled/jit time in nanoseconds
 */
long Thread#getCompTime();
```

Examples:
```
Thread th = Thread.currentThread();
System.out.format("Thread has spent %.6f seconds running compiled code\n", th.getCompTime() / 1e9);

Thread th2 = new Thread(new MyRunnable());
th2.start();
th2.join();
System.out.format("Thread 2 has spent %.6f seconds running interpreted code\n", th2.getIntTime() / 1e9);
```

## Class loading profiling
OpenJDK comes with many class loading performance counters from the `sun.misc.PerfCounter` class. HotTub adds in some additional counters with a focus per-thread counters. HotTub also adds the property `PrintClassLoading` that can be used to print out the per-thread class loading counters on thread exit (add `-DPrintClassLoading=true`).

For all available counters and their usage see the source file [jdk/src/share/classes/sun/misc/PerfCounter.java](jdk/src/share/classes/sun/misc/PerfCounter.java).
Some example methods to get the counters:
```
/**
 * Number of findClass calls
 */
public static PerfCounter getFindClasses()
public static PerfCounter tl_FindClasses() // thread-local version
/**
 * Time (ns) spent in finding classes that includes
 * lookup and read class bytes and defineClass
 */
public static PerfCounter getFindClassTime()
public static PerfCounter tl_FindClassTime() // thread-local version
/**
 * Time (ns) spent in the parent delegation to
 * the parent of the defining class loader
 */
public static PerfCounter getParentDelegationTime()
public static PerfCounter tl_ParentDelegationTime() // thread-local vesion
```

Usage example:
```
/**
 * Returns the current value of the perf counter.
 */
public synchronized long get()

long class_count = sun.misc.PerfCounter.getFindClasses().get();
long tl_class_count = sun.misc.PerfCounter.tl_FindClasses().get();
```

## Implementation notes
Notes will be added soon.

## Known issues and bugs
- HotTub sends a `ThreadDeath` error (extends `java.lang.Throwable`) to "cleanly" kill threads when an application finishes via `System.exit` or a signal
	- this causes a lot of backtraces to be printed, including locks and synchronization complaining about an `InterruptedException`
		- this is actually fine and these messages can be safely ignored; all threads are being killed and all data is being reset
	- TODO: implement another way of killing threads, or silence these backtraces if during a "HotTub shutdown"
- Segfault in jitted code, related to `sun.misc.Unsafe`
	- TODO: debug...
	- Workaround solution: disable jitting of methods with the [`-XX:CompileCommand`][3] flag (you can specify multiple)
		- Example: `-XX:CompileCommand=exclude,akka/actor/RepointableActorRef.underlying`
- Segfault in jitted `java.util.concurrent.LinkedBlockingQueue#take`, see trace below
	- Workaround solution: `-XX:CompileCommand=exclude,java/util/concurrent/LinkedBlockingQueue.take`
